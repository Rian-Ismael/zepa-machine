### ARM Assembly and Custom ISA Components

#### ARM Assembly and the ISA Register Design
- How ARM Assembly matches the custom ISA's register layout.
#### ARM Assembly and Memory Manipulation
- Breaking down ARM Assembly's backing for memory tasks and special registers like MAR and MDR.
#### ARM Assembly and Control Flow (Program Counter - PC)
- Using ARM Assembly commands to handle control flow and the program counter.
#### ARM Assembly and Arithmetic/Logical Operations
- Linking arithmetic and logical tasks like ADD and SUB from the custom ISA to ARM Assembly.
#### ARM Assembly and Status Flags/Comparison Operations
- Dealing with status flags and comparison instructions in ARM Assembly.
#### ARM Assembly and Load/Store Operations
- Moving data between memory and registers by using ARM Assembly's LOAD and STORE instructions.
